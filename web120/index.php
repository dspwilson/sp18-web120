 <p>My primary interest is cartography.  I focus on large scale maps for print and web.  These maps describe things like Seattle Public Art for walking tours and Forgotten Trails in our mountains.</p>
 <p>Great living cartographers I admire are Cynthia Brewer, Tom Patterson, and Tom Harrison.</p>
 <p>I took the domain name of Ohanapecosh.  Ohanapecosh names an extraordinary river in Mount Rainier National Park.Â  The river originates from the Ohanapecosh Glacier on Mount Rainier.  Ohanapecosh, an ancient Taidnapam &lpar;Upper Cowlitz&rpar; Native American word, is thought to mean <q>standing at the edge</q>.</p>
